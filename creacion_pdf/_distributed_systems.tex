\section{Methodology}

Our methodology is designed to ensure a comprehensive and systematic analysis of scientific literature. The methodology used in this study builds on our previous work, including a methodology that leverages machine learning and natural language processing techniques \cite{Hurtado2023}, and a novel method for predicting the importance of scientific articles on topics of interest using natural language processing and recurrent neural networks \cite{Lopez2024}. The process is structured into three phases: data preparation, topic modeling, and the generation and integration of knowledge representations. Each phase is essential for transforming raw text data into meaningful insights, and the detailed parameters and algorithm are explained below. The table \ref{tabDescription} describes the parameters for understanding the overall process and algorithm. The high-level process is presented in Fig. \ref{fig:Methodology}, and the detailed algorithm is outlined in Table \ref{tab:Algorithm}.\\ 

In the data preparation phase, we focus on extracting and cleaning text from scientific documents using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This phase involves several steps to ensure that the text data is ready for analysis. First, text is extracted from the documents, and non-alphabetic characters that do not add value to the analysis are removed. Next, the text is converted to lowercase, and stopwords (common words that do not contribute much meaning) are removed. We then apply lemmatization, which transforms words to their base form (e.g., "running" becomes "run"). Each document is tokenized (split into individual words or terms), and n-grams (combinations of words) are identified to find common terms. We generate a unified set of common terms, denoted as $TE$, which includes both the terms extracted from the documents and basic terms relevant to any field of study, such as [Fundamentals, Evaluation of Solutions, Trends]. Finally, each document is vectorized with respect to $TE$, resulting in the Document-Term Matrix (DTM).\\

The DTM is a crucial component for topic modeling. It is a matrix where the rows represent the documents in the corpus, and the columns represent the terms (words or n-grams) extracted from the corpus. Each cell in the matrix contains a value indicating the presence or frequency of a term in a document. This structured representation of the text data allows us to apply machine learning techniques to uncover hidden patterns.\\

In the topic modeling phase, we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a popular machine learning technique for identifying topics within a set of documents. By applying LDA to the DTM, we transform the matrix into a space of topics. Specifically, LDA provides us with two key matrices: the Topic-Term Matrix ($\beta$) and the Document-Topic Matrix ($\theta$). The Topic-Term Matrix ($\beta$) indicates the probability that a term is associated with a specific topic, while the Document-Topic Matrix ($\theta$) indicates the probability that a document belongs to a specific topic. For each topic in $\beta$, we assign a name by combining the most probable terms associated with that topic. This process results in the set $T$, which contains the most relevant topics, and the set $K$, which contains the most relevant terms. Additionally, we generate a graph $G_{tk}$ to represent the relationships between topics and terms. Using a language generation model, we refine the names of the topics to ensure they are concise and meaningful, with a maximum of $W_{t}$ words.\\

The final phase involves the generation and integration of knowledge representations, which include summaries, keywords, and interactive visualizations. For each topic $t$ in $T$, we identify the $N$ most relevant documentsรขโฌโthose with the highest probabilities in $\theta$. This set, $D_t$, represents the documents most closely related to each topic. We then generate summaries of these documents, each with a maximum of $W_b$ words, using a language generation model. These summaries include references to the most relevant documents, which are added to the set $R_d$ if they are not already included. We also integrate all the summaries and generate $J$ suggested keywords using a language generation model. Additionally, we create interactive graphs from the $G_{tk}$ graph, showcasing nodes and relationships between the topics and terms, and highlighting significant connections.\\

This methodology provides a clear, structured approach to analyzing scientific literature, leveraging advanced NLP and machine learning techniques to generate useful and comprehensible knowledge representations. This is the methodology used in the development of this study, which presents the fundamentals, solution evaluation techniques, trends, and other topics of interest within this field of study. This structured approach ensures a thorough review and synthesis of the current state of knowledge, providing valuable insights and a solid foundation for future research.

The Eco.District.Heat-kit, a novel planning model, supports decision-making processes for grid-bound heating. This interdisciplinary approach evaluates the feasibility of district heating systems from both qualitative and quantitative standpoints, enabling a more efficient pre-evaluation using readily available data \cite{Susanna_2019}.

Furthermore, the emergence of Renewable Energy Communities in European legislation promotes local energy production and consumption, contributing to the decarbonization of the building sector. Research has shown that low-temperature district heating networks, coupled with distributed heat pumps, can effectively harness renewable and waste heat sources. However, the seasonal mismatch between heating demand and photovoltaic (PV) production limits the increase in self-consumption from these distributed systems. Despite this, the environmental benefits are substantial, with CO2 emissions potentially reduced by up to 80% depending on the installed PV capacity \cite{Jacopo_2022}. This highlights the role of shared local power plants in optimizing the techno-economic performance of advanced heating networks.

In addition to energy systems, the field of active noise control (ANC) illustrates the complexity of distributed technologies. ANC systems utilize multiple loudspeakers and microphones to effectively reduce noise in various environments. Recent advancements address the challenges of creating larger quiet zones with improved noise reduction capabilities. Various factors, such as acoustic design and control strategies, are crucial in enhancing the performance of multichannel ANC systems, thereby paving the way for practical applications in real-world scenarios \cite{Yijing_2022}.

Computational geometry (CG) also plays a significant role in the development of distributed systems, particularly in mobile robotics. The algorithms derived from CG are essential for solving complex optimization problems related to automated path planning. Recent studies have demonstrated the application of CG principles in both single and multi-robot systems, highlighting its potential for improving efficiency in robotic operations \cite{Ehsan_2023}. 

Additionally, the rapid advancement of energy harvesting technologies is transforming the landscape for self-powered sensors and IoT applications. These technologies enable devices to utilize distributed energy sources, enhancing their sustainability and efficiency. The review of energy harvesting technologies discusses various applications, including smart homes and transportation systems, showcasing the potential for future developments in smart cities, especially in the context of the 5G era \cite{Long_2021}.
