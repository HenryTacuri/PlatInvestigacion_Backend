\begin{abstract}
This article presents a comprehensive overview of the integration of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques in brain tumor histopathology, focusing on glioblastoma (GBM). Our methodology ensures a systematic analysis of scientific literature, beginning with meticulous data preparation using advanced natural language processing techniques. We employ Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify and categorize underlying topics, which leads to the development of a recommendation system that suggests relevant articles. By creating various knowledge representations, including textual summaries and visualizations, we synthesize the main findings into an accessible format, culminating in a user	extendash{}friendly report.

The systematic review of 54 studies reveals that while ML/DL methods are increasingly utilized for classifying and segmenting tumor types, the integration of biological data with histopathological findings remains limited. Many studies lack rigorous reporting standards, raising concerns about reproducibility. The review underscores the predominance of support vector machines and convolutional neural networks in GBM research but highlights a gap in studies that effectively combine histological and molecular data. This integration is essential for advancing understanding of GBM pathogenesis and improving patient outcomes. In conclusion, while ML/DL approaches show promise in this field, future research should prioritize methodological rigor and interdisciplinary collaboration to develop comprehensive models that enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment strategies for GBM.

\section{Introduction}
The application of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) in various domains has revolutionized the way complex problems are approached, particularly in the fields of medicine and biomedical research. One area where these technologies have shown remarkable promise is in understanding and diagnosing brain tumors, specifically glioblastoma (GBM). GBM is notorious for its aggressive behavior and heterogeneity, making it a challenging target for traditional diagnostic methods. The integration of advanced computational techniques offers a new frontier for improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment strategies, underscoring the importance of exploring these methodologies in depth.

As the prevalence of brain tumors continues to rise, there is an urgent need for innovative solutions that enhance diagnostic capabilities. Traditional diagnostic approaches heavily rely on the expertise of pathologists and radiologists, which can be time	extendash{}consuming and prone to human error. This reality presents a compelling motivation for the adoption of automated systems that leverage ML and DL for more accurate and efficient tumor classification and segmentation. By using algorithms that can analyze vast amounts of data, researchers can uncover complex patterns and relationships that human observers might overlook, thus improving the overall understanding of GBM and its implications for patient outcomes.

Despite the promising advancements, the implementation of ML and DL in GBM research is still in its nascent stages, revealing a significant gap in the literature. A systematic review of studies indicates that while numerous applications of these techniques exist, many focus solely on the classification and segmentation of tumor types based on histopathological data. The majority of the research has not adequately integrated genomic and clinical data, which are crucial for enhancing the understanding of tumor behavior and patient outcomes. This lack of interdisciplinary approaches highlights the need for comprehensive methodologies that can bridge the gap between various data types, allowing for a holistic view of GBM pathogenesis.

Addressing these challenges is imperative, as the integration of multiple data sources can lead to more personalized and effective treatment plans for GBM patients. For example, studies have shown that the presence of specific molecular markers can significantly influence tumor classification and prognosis when combined with histopathological features. However, many current studies fall short of reporting their training and evaluation methodologies in detail, which raises concerns about the reproducibility and robustness of the developed models. Improving transparency in data reporting and methodology is essential for fostering trust in these models and ensuring that they can be effectively utilized in clinical settings.

To tackle the identified problems, recent investigations have proposed several methodologies that leverage ML and DL techniques. Support Vector Machines (SVM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) have emerged as popular choices for classification and segmentation tasks, particularly in the context of histopathological images. These models have demonstrated the ability to extract meaningful features from complex data, leading to improved accuracy in predicting tumor grades and patient survival outcomes. Furthermore, hybrid approaches that combine traditional machine learning methods with deep learning architectures have shown promise in enhancing classification performance and robustness.

Our methodology for conducting a comprehensive survey of the literature surrounding ML and DL applications in GBM is designed to ensure a systematic analysis of scientific literature. It begins with the careful preparation of text data, utilizing advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to clean and refine the information. This initial step is crucial for ensuring high	extendash{}quality data that is ready for detailed analysis. Once the data has been prepared, we employ Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify and categorize the underlying topics within the text, allowing us to uncover hidden thematic structures. This process not only aids in the organization of the literature but also facilitates the development of a recommendation system that suggests the most relevant articles, enhancing the coherence of the survey.

Moreover, the creation of various knowledge representations is integral to synthesizing the main findings of our survey. This includes generating textual summaries and visualizing relationships between topics and documents. By employing the GPT API to generate explanatory text, we ensure that the findings are presented in an accessible format, ultimately leading to a comprehensive report that combines text and figures for a complete overview of the analysis. The final product reflects a robust and automated approach to creating survey articles, aiming to bridge the existing gaps in GBM research.

In conclusion, while the application of ML and DL techniques in GBM histopathology presents significant potential, much more work is needed to fully realize their capabilities. The integration of diverse data types and improved transparency in research methodologies are critical steps toward enhancing diagnostic and prognostic tools. By fostering interdisciplinary collaborations and standardizing practices, the field can advance toward more effective and personalized treatment strategies for GBM patients, ultimately improving survival rates and quality of life. As highlighted in our survey, the future of GBM research lies in the successful amalgamation of computational techniques with biological insights, paving the way for breakthroughs in understanding this complex disease.

\section{Methodology}

Our methodology is designed to ensure a comprehensive and systematic analysis of scientific literature. The methodology used in this study builds on our previous work, including a methodology that leverages machine learning and natural language processing techniques \cite{Hurtado2023}, and a novel method for predicting the importance of scientific articles on topics of interest using natural language processing and recurrent neural networks \cite{Lopez2024}. The process is structured into three phases: data preparation, topic modeling, and the generation and integration of knowledge representations. Each phase is essential for transforming raw text data into meaningful insights, and the detailed parameters and algorithm are explained below. The table \ref{tabDescription} describes the parameters for understanding the overall process and algorithm. The high-level process is presented in Fig. \ref{fig:Methodology}, and the detailed algorithm is outlined in Table \ref{tab:Algorithm}.\\ 

In the data preparation phase, we focus on extracting and cleaning text from scientific documents using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This phase involves several steps to ensure that the text data is ready for analysis. First, text is extracted from the documents, and non-alphabetic characters that do not add value to the analysis are removed. Next, the text is converted to lowercase, and stopwords (common words that do not contribute much meaning) are removed. We then apply lemmatization, which transforms words to their base form (e.g., "running" becomes "run"). Each document is tokenized (split into individual words or terms), and n-grams (combinations of words) are identified to find common terms. We generate a unified set of common terms, denoted as $TE$, which includes both the terms extracted from the documents and basic terms relevant to any field of study, such as [Fundamentals, Evaluation of Solutions, Trends]. Finally, each document is vectorized with respect to $TE$, resulting in the Document-Term Matrix (DTM).\\

The DTM is a crucial component for topic modeling. It is a matrix where the rows represent the documents in the corpus, and the columns represent the terms (words or n-grams) extracted from the corpus. Each cell in the matrix contains a value indicating the presence or frequency of a term in a document. This structured representation of the text data allows us to apply machine learning techniques to uncover hidden patterns.\\

In the topic modeling phase, we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a popular machine learning technique for identifying topics within a set of documents. By applying LDA to the DTM, we transform the matrix into a space of topics. Specifically, LDA provides us with two key matrices: the Topic-Term Matrix ($\beta$) and the Document-Topic Matrix ($\theta$). The Topic-Term Matrix ($\beta$) indicates the probability that a term is associated with a specific topic, while the Document-Topic Matrix ($\theta$) indicates the probability that a document belongs to a specific topic.

To enhance this approach, we integrate predefined topic representations and refine document-topic assignments. In addition to extracting topics purely from the document-term matrix (DTM), we incorporate a set of predefined topics, namely [Fundamentals, Evaluation of Solutions, Trends], which are represented using a predefined set of keywords generated by a language generation model. This ensures that the model captures both the inherent structure of the dataset and domain-relevant themes. The predefined topics are processed through a keyword extraction function, which selects the most relevant words associated with each topic based on the provided corpus.

To construct a more robust topic representation, we create predefined topic matrices that integrate predefined topic vectors with the most relevant keywords extracted for each topic. These matrices are then normalized and combined with the LDA-generated topic distribution, ensuring a refined alignment of document-topic assignments. By doing so, we mitigate the limitations of purely unsupervised topic modeling, which might generate topics that lack semantic clarity.

Finally, to improve interpretability, we assign meaningful names to the discovered topics by combining the highest-probability terms from the topic-term matrix ($\beta$). Using a language generation model, we generate concise and descriptive topic names, ensuring that each topic is easily understandable. This process results in a refined set of topics ($T$), the most relevant terms ($K$), and a topic-term graph ($G_{tk}$) that illustrates relationships between topics and key terms. This methodology enhances the effectiveness of topic modeling by integrating both machine learning and domain-specific knowledge, leading to a more structured and meaningful representation of the analyzed corpus.

The final phase involves the generation and integration of knowledge representations, which include summaries, keywords, and interactive visualizations. For each topic $t$ in $T$, we identify the $N$ most relevant documentsâ€”those with the highest probabilities in $\theta$. This set, $D_t$, represents the documents most closely related to each topic. We then generate summaries of these documents, each with a maximum of $W_b$ words, using a language generation model. These summaries include references to the most relevant documents, which are added to the set $R_d$ if they are not already included. We also integrate all the summaries and generate $J$ suggested keywords using a language generation model. Additionally, we create interactive graphs from the $G_{tk}$ graph, showcasing nodes and relationships between the topics and terms, and highlighting significant connections.We also integrate all the summaries and generate $J$ suggested keywords using a language generation model. Additionally, the topic titles were improved based on the generated summaries using a language generation model, ensuring that the final topic names more accurately reflect the summarized content.
\\

This methodology provides a clear, structured approach to analyzing scientific literature, leveraging advanced NLP and machine learning techniques to generate useful and comprehensible knowledge representations. This is the methodology used in the development of this study, which presents the fundamentals, solution evaluation techniques, trends, and other topics of interest within this field of study. This structured approach ensures a thorough review and synthesis of the current state of knowledge, providing valuable insights and a solid foundation for future research.

\section{Fundamental of lda}
Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques have shown significant potential in advancing brain tumor histopathology research, particularly for glioblastoma (GBM), which is known for its complex pathogenesis and heterogeneity. Despite the promising applications of ML/DL in various medical fields, their implementation in GBM histopathological studies has been comparatively limited. A systematic review of existing literature reveals that a majority of studies have focused on the classification and segmentation of tumor types using ML/DL methods based on histopathological data, often correlating these findings with genomic and clinical data to enhance understanding of tumor behavior and patient outcomes. 

Recent investigations indicate a growing trend towards integrating bioinformatics with histopathological analysis, emphasizing the necessity of using a multi-omics approach to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment strategies for GBM. For instance, several studies have illustrated that the presence of specific molecular markers can significantly influence tumor classification and prognosis when combined with histopathological data. However, many of these studies have not adequately reported their training and evaluation methodologies, raising concerns about reproducibility and the robustness of the models developed. 

The review highlights that the most commonly used ML/DL models in GBM-related research are support vector machines (SVM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), specifically those based on architectures like ResNet and U-Net. These models have been employed to extract features from histopathological images and have shown promise in predicting tumor grades and patient survival outcomes. Nonetheless, there remains a significant gap in literature concerning the comprehensive integration of histopathological data with other omics data types. Only a small subset of studies has effectively utilized this integration to uncover deeper biological insights into GBM pathogenesis.

Moreover, the systematic review indicates that while there is a robust interest in the application of ML/DL techniques, the majority of studies tend to focus on enhancing model performance metrics without sufficiently addressing the underlying biological complexities of GBM. This limitation underscores the need for more interdisciplinary approaches that combine histopathological data with molecular and genomic insights. Such strategies could lead to the development of more effective and personalized treatment plans for GBM patients.

In conclusion, although ML/DL approaches are making strides in the field of GBM histopathological research, there is still much work to be done. Future studies should aim to standardize methodologies, improve data reporting practices, and focus on the integration of diverse data types to foster a more comprehensive understanding of GBM. This could ultimately lead to better diagnostic and prognostic tools that are accessible and applicable in clinical settings.

\section{Evaluation of lda}
The application of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques in the analysis of brain tumor histopathology, particularly glioblastoma (GBM), has gained significant traction recently, highlighting the potential for these technologies to enhance understanding and treatment of this complex disease. Despite the advancements in ML/DL methods, the integration of these approaches into GBM histopathological studies remains limited, suggesting a gap that could be addressed to improve diagnostic and prognostic outcomes. A systematic review of the literature reveals that while numerous studies have utilized ML/DL techniques for analyzing histopathological data, only a small subset has focused specifically on GBM, with many others exploring various brain tumors without establishing a clear correlation between biological and histopathological data.

The review analyzed 54 eligible studies, revealing that most research has concentrated on employing ML/DL for classification and segmentation tasks in brain tumor histopathology, with an emphasis on identifying tumor subtypes and predicting patient survival. Among the studies reviewed, 37 were specifically related to GBM, indicating a strong research interest in this area. However, the majority of these studies primarily relied on traditional histopathological analyses, often failing to integrate additional -omics data that could provide deeper insights into tumor biology and patient outcomes. For instance, while some studies have successfully correlated histopathological features with molecular markers, the overall trend shows a lack of comprehensive approaches that combine various data types to enhance the understanding of GBM's heterogeneity and pathogenesis \cite{Chun_2025}.

Furthermore, the review highlights a concerning trend regarding the reporting standards in ML/DL research within this field. Many studies did not adequately specify their training and evaluation methodologies, making it challenging to assess the reproducibility and robustness of the models utilized. This lack of transparency is particularly problematic given the critical implications of GBM diagnoses and the potential for ML/DL tools to significantly impact clinical decision-making. The review suggests that improved reporting standards, including clear definitions of data sources, model training processes, and evaluation metrics, would facilitate better comparisons and validation of ML/DL applications in brain tumor research \cite{Chun_2025}.

Moreover, the findings suggest a growing interest in integrating histopathological data with genomic and proteomic information to create more comprehensive predictive models. Studies that employed such integrative approaches demonstrated enhanced classification accuracy and provided valuable insights into tumor characteristics and behaviors. For example, some research has successfully utilized multiscale feature extraction and deep learning architectures to uncover complex relationships between histological features and molecular profiles, thus paving the way for personalized treatment strategies \cite{Chun_2025}.

In conclusion, while there is a burgeoning interest in the application of ML/DL methods in GBM histopathology, significant work remains to be done to fully realize the potential of these technologies. By fostering collaborations that emphasize the integration of diverse data types and improving the standardization of reporting in research, the field can move towards more robust and generalizable models that ultimately enhance patient care and outcomes. Future research should prioritize these integrative strategies to ensure that the insights gained are not only statistically significant but also clinically relevant, thereby contributing to the ongoing battle against GBM and improving survival rates for patients \cite{Chun_2025}.
\section{Automated tumor classification}
Automated brain tumor classification from MRI images has become increasingly crucial due to the high mortality rates associated with brain cancer. Traditional diagnostic methods rely heavily on the expertise of radiologists, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors, especially given the complex nature of brain tumors. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have presented promising solutions. This paper proposes an enhanced model using Residual Networks (ResNet) to classify various types of brain tumors, including Meningiomas, Gliomas, and Pituitary tumors, with a high degree of accuracy.

The proposed approach utilizes a benchmark dataset comprising 3064 MRI images of brain tumors. Extensive data augmentation techniques, such as horizontal and vertical flipping, rotation, shifting, zooming, ZCA whitening, shearing, and brightness manipulation, were employed to increase the dataset's diversity and improve classification accuracy. The model's architecture is designed to handle the challenges posed by the inherent complexities of MRI images, such as varied shapes and intensities of tumors. By leveraging the ResNet50 architecture, the model can manage deeper networks effectively, mitigating issues related to vanishing gradients and accuracy degradation commonly found in traditional neural networks \cite{Sarah_2020}.

The results of the proposed model are promising, achieving a classification accuracy of 99% for image-level evaluations and 97% for patient-level assessments. These results are superior to previous approaches that reported accuracies ranging from 84% to 93% \cite{Sarah_2020}. The use of ResNet not only facilitates high accuracy but also allows for better generalization across different tumor types due to its ability to learn rich feature representations from the data. Moreover, metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model performance, addressing the limitations of relying solely on accuracy, especially in imbalanced datasets \cite{Sarah_2020}.

In comparison to earlier methodologies which required manual feature extraction and segmentation prior to classification, the deep learning approach streamlines the process, automatically learning features from raw MRI data. This not only enhances efficiency but also reduces the likelihood of manual errors that can occur during the preprocessing stages \cite{Sarah_2020}. The effectiveness of the proposed model highlights the potential of deep learning techniques in improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency in medical imaging, particularly for challenging cases such as brain tumors.

Future work is suggested to expand on this research by exploring larger datasets and incorporating additional tumor types, which can further validate the robustness of the model. By optimizing the model for various imaging modalities, including X-rays and ultrasounds, the proposed approach could be adapted for broader applications within medical diagnostics. Overall, the integration of advanced AI methodologies in the classification of brain tumors from MRI images shows significant potential to enhance clinical decision-making processes and improve patient outcomes in the fight against cancer.
\section{Dcb unet segmentation}
Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced the automatic segmentation of brain tumors in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Effective segmentation plays a crucial role in the diagnosis and treatment of brain tumors, as it aids in identifying tumor boundaries and characteristics, which are essential for clinical decision-making. Traditional manual segmentation methods are not only time-consuming but also prone to human error, leading to an increased need for automated solutions. Deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have emerged as a powerful alternative, offering improved accuracy and efficiency in this domain \cite{Akter_2024, Ullah_2023, Zhao_2024}.

The UNet architecture has been widely used for biomedical image segmentation, including brain tumor detection, due to its ability to capture spatial hierarchies through its encoder-decoder structure. However, conventional UNet models often struggle with feature extraction and contextual information fusion, which can negatively impact segmentation accuracy \cite{Ronneberger_2015, Lu_2022, Jena_2023}. To address these limitations, recent research has focused on integrating advanced techniques such as attention mechanisms and residual connections into the UNet framework. Such modifications have led to the development of hybrid architectures that enhance feature representation and improve segmentation performance.

One promising approach is the introduction of the Depthwise Convolution Bottleneck (DCB) within the UNet architecture. This method leverages depthwise convolutions to reduce the number of parameters while maintaining the model's ability to learn complex features. By incorporating depthwise convolutions into the skip connections, the DCB-UNet model effectively transfers high-level features from the encoder to the decoder, enhancing the overall segmentation quality \cite{Koh_2020, Daimary_2020, Havaei_2017}. The model's architecture allows for better preservation of spatial information, which is critical for accurately delineating tumor boundaries.

Experimental results demonstrate that the DCB-UNet model outperforms traditional UNet and other state-of-the-art segmentation methods. For instance, the model achieved an impressive accuracy of 99.82%, an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 83.34%, and a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 90.83% across various test datasets \cite{Hanine_2024, Sathish_2024, Shomirov_2022}. These metrics indicate not only the model's effectiveness in distinguishing tumor regions from healthy brain tissue but also its potential for clinical application in routine diagnostic processes.

Moreover, the integration of data augmentation strategies during training has further improved the model's robustness and generalizability. By employing techniques such as rotation, scaling, and shearing, the training dataset is effectively expanded, allowing the model to learn from a broader range of variations in tumor presentation \cite{Garcea_2023, Buda_2019, Prados_2017}. This approach mitigates the risk of overfitting and enhances the model's ability to perform well on unseen data.

As brain tumors exhibit significant variability in size, shape, and location, the DCB-UNet model's ability to maintain high accuracy across diverse cases is particularly noteworthy. The use of depthwise convolutions not only simplifies the network but also facilitates the extraction of intricate features that are often crucial for accurate segmentation. Consequently, the DCB-UNet model stands out as a robust solution for automated brain tumor segmentation, promising to advance clinical practice by providing timely and precise diagnostic information \cite{Kumar_2023, Joshi_2024, Xu_2024}.

In conclusion, the integration of depthwise convolution bottleneck blocks into the UNet architecture has yielded significant improvements in brain tumor segmentation. The DCB-UNet model demonstrates superior performance metrics, establishing it as a leading technique in the realm of medical image analysis. Future research should focus on further enhancing this model and evaluating its effectiveness across different imaging modalities and clinical scenarios to solidify its role in the diagnostic workflow \cite{Ding_2019, Karimzadeh_2021, Liu_2023}.
\section{Deep learning glioblastoma}
Deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as powerful tools in the realm of brain tumor histopathology, particularly in the study of glioblastoma (GBM). This systematic review analyzes the application of these advanced computational methods in understanding GBM pathology by integrating histological data with genomic and proteomic information. The increasing complexity of GBM's pathogenesis necessitates innovative approaches to enhance diagnostic and prognostic capabilities in clinical settings.

A comprehensive analysis of 54 relevant studies reveals a significant trend towards employing ML/DL methodologies to dissect the intricacies of GBM. Notably, the review indicates that while many studies focus on the classification of tumor grades and subtypes or the segmentation of tumor microenvironments, only a limited number successfully integrate biological data with histopathological findings. This integration is crucial for developing models that can predict patient outcomes based on histological features and underlying molecular characteristics \cite{20,34,41}.

The findings further highlight the predominance of certain ML/DL models in GBM research. Support Vector Machines (SVM) and k-nearest neighbors (kNN) are frequently utilized classifiers, while Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly those based on ResNet and U-Net architectures, dominate the segmentation tasks. The review emphasizes that combining these models with ensemble techniques can yield improved classification performance and robustness in predictions \cite{33,41,42}.

Despite the advancements, several limitations persist in the current body of research. A notable concern is the lack of transparency in reporting data sources and the methodologies used for training and evaluating models. Many studies do not specify the origin of their datasets, leading to reproducibility issues and potential biases in model performance evaluations. Furthermore, a significant number of studies utilize single-source datasets, which may not adequately represent the heterogeneity observed in GBM patients across different populations \cite{32,34,36}.

The review also identifies a gap in studies that effectively utilize ML/DL techniques to uncover biological insights related to GBM pathology. While there is a growing interest in integrating H\&E-stained images with other -omics data, only a few studies have successfully contextualized these relationships to gain a deeper understanding of GBM. For instance, recent research demonstrates that combining histological features with genomic and transcriptomic data can lead to enhanced predictive capabilities for patient survival and treatment response, indicating that future investigations should prioritize this integrative approach \cite{30,34,48}.

In conclusion, the review underscores the potential of ML/DL techniques to advance our understanding of GBM histopathology, while also highlighting the need for improved reporting standards and data transparency in the field. By fostering collaborative efforts and utilizing diverse datasets, future research can lead to the development of comprehensive models that not only enhance diagnostic accuracy but also provide valuable insights into the complex biology of GBM.
\section{Trends of lda}
The advancement of deep learning and medical imaging has significantly impacted early cancer detection, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Cancer, marked by uncontrolled cell growth, poses serious health risks and presents various challenges in detection and treatment. Early detection is crucial, as it greatly improves the chances of successful treatment and survival rates. Medical imaging technologies, such as X-rays, CT scans, MRI, and ultrasound, are essential for identifying different types of cancer, but their manual interpretation can be subjective and time-consuming. Therefore, there is a pressing need for automated systems to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing cancer more effectively \cite{Istiak_2024}.

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of cancer detection methods, examining 99 research articles published between 2020 and 2024. The scope of the study encompasses 12 cancer types, including breast, cervical, ovarian, prostate, esophageal, liver, pancreatic, colon, lung, oral, brain, and skin cancers. Various techniques are discussed, including medical imaging data acquisition, image preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and deep learning methodologies. The integration of deep learning algorithms into the cancer detection process has shown promising results, as these algorithms can efficiently analyze large datasets and recognize complex patterns that human observers might overlook \cite{Istiak_2024}.

One of the primary challenges in cancer detection is the imbalance in datasets, where non-cancerous images often outnumber cancerous ones. This imbalance can lead to biased models that fail to adequately address minority classes, resulting in a higher false negative rate \cite{Istiak_2024}. Additionally, accurate labeling of medical images is critical, yet it can be hindered by inter-observer variability, necessitating expert radiologists for annotation. Furthermore, the limited availability of high-quality medical images due to privacy concerns and the high costs associated with obtaining and labeling data poses significant obstacles in the development of robust detection systems.

Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool in medical imaging, with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) being the most commonly used architecture for cancer detection. CNNs excel at extracting meaningful features from images, enabling precise identification of tumors and other abnormalities. Techniques such as transfer learning, where models pre-trained on large datasets are fine-tuned on specific cancer datasets, have proven effective in improving performance despite limited available data \cite{Istiak_2024}. Hybrid models that integrate traditional machine learning approaches with deep learning architectures are also being explored to enhance interpretability and performance.

Segmentation is another critical aspect of cancer detection, as it involves accurately delineating tumors from healthy tissue. Advanced techniques such as U-Net and region-based CNNs have been employed to improve segmentation accuracy, allowing for better visualization of tumor boundaries and characteristics \cite{Istiak_2024}. Moreover, evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC are essential for assessing the performance of detection models, ensuring that they provide reliable diagnostic information.

The findings from this survey highlight the importance of addressing data quality and quantity issues, enhancing model generalization, and improving interpretability in cancer detection systems. Future research should focus on developing robust models that can handle diverse datasets, integrating multiple imaging modalities, and ensuring ethical considerations are met in the use of AI in healthcare. By leveraging the advancements in deep learning and medical imaging, the goal is to create accurate and reliable cancer detection systems that can ultimately lead to better patient outcomes \cite{Istiak_2024}.
