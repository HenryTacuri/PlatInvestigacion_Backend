abstract = {Recommender systems are essential tools in the digital era, providing personalized content to users across various domains, including e-commerce, entertainment, and social media. Among the numerous approaches developed for these systems, latent factor models have proven to be particularly effective. This survey systematically reviews latent factor models in recommender systems, highlighting their core principles, methodologies, and recent advancements. The literature is analyzed through a structured framework that organizes prior work into a well-defined taxonomy based on four key aspects where advancements in latent factor models have occurred: learning data, model architecture, learning strategies, and optimization techniques. The analysis includes a taxonomy of contributions and detailed discussions on the types of learning data used, such as implicit feedback, trust data, and content data. Additionally, it explores various models, including probabilistic, nonlinear, and neural models, and examines diverse learning strategies like online learning, transfer learning, and active learning. Furthermore, the survey addresses the optimization strategies employed to train latent factor models, which enhance their performance and scalability. By identifying trends, gaps, and potential research directions, this survey aims to provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners seeking to advance the field of recommender systems.}
