abstract = {Cancer, characterized by the uncontrolled division of abnormal cells that harm body tissues, necessitates early detection for effective treatment. Medical imaging is crucial for identifying various cancers, yet its manual interpretation by radiologists is often subjective, labour-intensive, and time-consuming. Consequently, there is a critical need for an automated decision-making process to enhance cancer detection and diagnosis. Previously, a lot of work was done on surveys of different cancer detection methods, and most of them were focused on specific cancers and limited techniques. This study presents a comprehensive survey of cancer detection methods. It entails a review of 99 research articles collected from the Web of Science, IEEE, and Scopus databases, published between 2020 and 2024. The scope of the study encompasses 12 types of cancer, including breast, cervical, ovarian, prostate, esophageal, liver, pancreatic, colon, lung, oral, brain, and skin cancers. This study discusses different cancer detection techniques, including medical imaging data, image preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, deep learning and transfer learning methods, and evaluation metrics. Eventually, we summarised the datasets and techniques with research challenges and limitations. Finally, we provide future directions for enhancing cancer detection techniques.}
