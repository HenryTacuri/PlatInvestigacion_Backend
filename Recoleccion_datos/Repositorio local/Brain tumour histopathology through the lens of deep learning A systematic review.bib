Problem
Machine learning (ML)/Deep learning (DL) techniques have been evolving to solve more complex diseases, but it has been used relatively little in Glioblastoma (GBM) histopathological studies, which could benefit greatly due to the disease's complex pathogenesis.
Aim
Conduct a systematic review to investigate how ML/DL techniques have influenced the progression of brain tumour histopathological research, particularly in GBM.
Methods
54 eligible studies were collected from the PubMed and ScienceDirect databases, and their information about the types of brain tumour/s used, types of -omics data used with histopathological data, origins of the data, types of ML/DL and its training and evaluation methodologies, and the ML/DL task it was set to perform in the study were extracted to inform us of trends in GBM-related ML/DL-based research.
Results
Only 8 GBM-related studies in the eligible utilised ML/DL methodologies to gain deeper insights into GBM pathogenesis by contextualising histological data with -omics data. However, we report that these studies have been published more recently. The most popular ML/DL models used in GBM-related research are the SVM classifier and ResNet-based CNN architecture. Still, a considerable number of studies failed to state training and evaluative methodologies clearly.
Conclusion
There is a growing trend towards using ML/DL approaches to uncover relationships between biological and histopathological data to bring new insights into GBM, thus pushing GBM research forward. Much work still needs to be done to properly report the ML/DL methodologies to showcase the modelsâ€™ robustness and generalizability and ensure the models are reproducible.}
