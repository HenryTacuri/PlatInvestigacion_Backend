abstract = {Automated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) segmentation plays an important role for the diagnosis and evaluation of brain tumors. However, it involves many challenges, including large variations in the shape and types of brain tumors, especially small ones that are difficult to diagnose early, and the complex border patterns that lead to missing data and low segmentation accuracy, putting specialists under time pressure. In this paper, we propose a new, lightweight network based on Unet by integrating skip connections with depthwise convolutional layers. This complementary technique allows us to improve the performance of the Unet model in explaining and analyzing medical images in a comprehensive and effective manner by transferring information from advanced layers to lower layers with greater quality. It helps avoid information loss and contributes to improving the networkâ€™s ability to extract features better. Our suggested approach produced superior results compared to other Unet-like networks, as evidenced by the following metrics: accuracy of 99.82%, Intersection over union (IoU) of 83.34%, and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 90.83%. Experimental findings demonstrated that the skip connections reconstructed in depthwise Convolution Bottleneck (DCB-Unet) integrated multi-scale contextual semantic information. In contrast to the majority of contemporary medical image segmentation models, our suggested approach more precisely recognizes organs, lesions, and segments.}
